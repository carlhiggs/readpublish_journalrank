This repository contains code and results from an analysis of RMIT 2022 read and publish agreements for journals through Council of Australian Unviersity Librarians (CAUL), linked with scimagojr journal rankings (2019) by key terms of interest to population health, urban planning and environmental science.

RMIT's agreements are with Cambridge University Press, CSIRO, Springer and Wiley in particular.  Details on the read and publish agreements for these publishers can be located through https://caul.libguides.com/read-and-publish .

I linked the CAUL read and publish data with SCImago Journal & Country Rank data, which has been prepared for use in R by https://github.com/ikashnitsky/sjrdata

The linking of this data could help with deciding which journal to publish in.  The analysis could be modified to be run with other criteria, so I shared it here in case of use for others.
